#FindHap is used to impute missing genotypes in the genotype files for Landrace and Yorkshire swine breeds 
#Before running FindHap, we must make sure that our data formats align appropriately. 
#Have renamed 50K_Porcine_SNP_Data as "Chromosome.data" 

#Landrace Pedigree file must be ordered in ascending order of birthday; oldest to youngest animal;
x<- read.table("pedigree.file") 

#Check names of columns with: 
colnames(x)

#Rename columns appropriately with:
pri
colnames(x)[colnames(x) %in% c("V1", "V2", "V3", "V4", "V5")]<- c("Animal_ID", "Sire", "Dam", "Birthday", "Sex") 
# names are based on format provided in README document pertaining to the swine data files 

#Order the Landrace Pedigree file from oldest animal to youngest animal: 
newdataLRPed<- x[order(x$Birthday),]

#Remove row names and save with write.table: 
write.table(newdataLRPed, file= "newdataLRPed", append=FALSE, quote= FALSE, sep= " ", row.names=FALSE, col.names= TRUE)

#Reorder columns in format that corresponds to findhap.f90
