#FindHap is used to impute missing genotypes in the genotype files for Landrace and Yorkshire swine breeds 
#Before running FindHap, we must make sure that our data formats align appropriately. 
#Have renamed 50K_Porcine_SNP_Data as "Chromosome.data" 

#Landrace Pedigree file must be ordered in ascending order of birthday; oldest to youngest animal;
x<- read.table("chromosome.data") 

#Check names of columns with: 
colnames(x)

#Rename columns appropriately with:

colnames(x)[colnames(x) %in% c("V1", "V2", "V3", "V4", "V5")]<- c("Animal_ID", "Sire", "Dam", "Birthday", "Sex") 
# names are based on format provided in README document pertaining to the swine data files 

#Remove row names with write.table: 
write.table(x, append=FALSE, quote= FALSE, sep= " ", row.names=FALSE, col.names= TRUE)

#Order the Landrace Pedigree file from oldest animal to youngest animal: 
newdataLRPed<- x[order(x$Birthday),]

#Save new ordered Landrace Pedigree file with: 
save(newdataLRPed, file= "newdataLRPed")
#New Pedigree file is saved as a binary file, must convert to a csv file.
